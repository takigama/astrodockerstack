# Docker set for astrophotography

Its a bunch of custom containers that get built for doing astrophotography in linux. Yeah, i love containers a little too much, currently has
 - Astrometry
 - gphoto2
 - indiserver

Its based on what im currently doing to remote control a telescope using a Nexstar 6se and a Canon EOS camera

This should be easily portable between architectures using buildx


## TODO
 - moonlight (For remote desktop)
 - webtop (for all the desktop apps required)
 - so many other things
